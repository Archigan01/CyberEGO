Somehow, you made it this far. I mean, it was kind of easy, right? First one you looked through files and second one you were given a cheat sheet.
This time, I will only give you the description of the tactic used.

ROT13 - aka Caesar cipher, first used by Julius Caesar in the 1st century A.D., involves two letter wheels that can rotate independently. By matching letters up, you can get a different phrase than the original one.



















(hint: look up dCode ROT13)
