# Welcome

Hello, and thank you for showing up to the CHS Junior ROTC's 8th Grade Orientation. The cyber station is where you are at. I am C/Captain Reece White, the Cybersecurity Team Captain. I am a senior, so I will not see any of you next year; however, I am committed to this program and watching it succeed. Given I have time, I will pop in from time to time next year to see how things are going.

Anyways, I hope to see you all succeed and pass these challenges. If you have any questions, you can ask me.

This first challenge is very simple, alls you needs to do is just sift through the few files we have here and find and copy the flag to the website you saw when you first came in here.
