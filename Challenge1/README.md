# Welcome

Hello, and thank you for showing up to the CHS Junior ROTC's 8th Grade Orientation. The cyber station is where you are at. I am C/Captain Reece White, the Cybersecurity Team Captain. I am a senior, so I will not see any of you next year; however, I am committed to this program and watching it succeed. Given I have time, I will pop in from time to time next year to see how things are going.

Anyways, I hope to see you all succeed and pass these challenges. If you have any questions, you can ask me.
