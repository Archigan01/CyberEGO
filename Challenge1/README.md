Wow, congrats on making it to Challenge 3. This one deals with a Caesar cipher, aka the rotating cipher or ROT.

This cipher was first documented used by Julius Caesar in the first century A.D. The most common usage in handwriting is two concentric letter circles.

The inner one spins, and by taking the letter on the outer wheel and drawing a line towards the middle, you get the new letter, or vice versa. This is known as shifting a letter a fixed amount of letters on the letter wheel (usually 13).
